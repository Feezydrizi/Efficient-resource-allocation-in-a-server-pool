# Efficient energy resource allocation in a server pool
Energy efficiency is a major topic in every scientific field, since being energy efficient means producing more for a smaller cost. Data centers are no exception to this rule as their energy use represents a large portion of the global consumption, and it is needless to say that they ought to perform optimally while being eco-friendly in order to preserve natural resources as much as possible while providing a high quality service for the users. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient algorithm
for allocating users to a pool of servers in an energy-efficient way and we show that the performance of the so-called algorithm makes it worthy of being used in real-time environments where split-second decisions must be made. We compare our algorithm to the most well-known metaheuristics used in operations research and we show that they do not provide a significant improvementin a reasonable time.
